 Part of semester long project to build a data warehouse on NYC real estate data.

 In this project I will be building a data warehouse in MS Azure cloud storage for a fictional business requirement. For example, one of the business requirements is to develop an algorithm for high real estate investment ROI.

 As the project proceeds, I will include more information in this readme.
